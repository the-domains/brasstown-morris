# Brasstown Morris Dance

Brasstown Morris is comprised of three individual 
teams, known as "sides," who perform traditional English morris dances 
with an American flavor. We have a large and wonderful dance 
band with accordions, fiddles, drums, recorder, bass and guitar. All 
performers are members of the local community in the Brasstown, North Carolina area. 

The three groups include:

* Rural Felicity Garland Dancers, a women's 
side who have been dancing continuously at the folk school since 1983
* Sticks in the Mud Border Morris, a mixed side of men and women since 
1996
* Dames Rocket Northwest Clog Morris, a women's side founded in 
2005\.
